# NIP-402

## Macaroon-based Authentication of clients to relays

`draft` `optional` `author:buck`

extended from `nip-42`

This NIP defines a way for clients to authenticate to relays
by satisfying a 402 payment challenge

## Motivation

---

## FROM NIP-42

A relay may want to require clients to authenticate to access restricted resources. For example,

- A relay may request payment or other forms of whitelisting to publish events -- this can na√Øvely be achieved by limiting publication
  to events signed by the whitelisted key, but with this NIP they may choose to accept any events as long as they are published from an
  authenticated user;
- A relay may limit access to `kind: 4` DMs to only the parties involved in the chat exchange, and for that it may require authentication
  before clients can query for that kind.
- A relay may limit subscriptions of any kind to paying users or users whitelisted through any other means, and require authentication.

## 402

Ephemeral authorization lacks some flexibility for more
complex payment-based authorization schemes.

Using a macaroon-based system gives us some additional advantages:

- Auth can be directly tied to a payment as with HTTP 402
- Authorization can be reused in new sessions
- Authorization can be delegated. For example lets say that you have authorization to submit long and short notes and react, but you want to share the right to just do reactions. This information can be embedded in the paid authorization macaroon and then delegated via NIP-26 delegation
- Authorization can be sold. The Nostr protocol allows us to track in a decentralized way the movement of an "asset" like a macaroon. This will need to be done via a different event type.

## Definitions

This NIP extends the `AUTH` message type, which relays can send when they support authentication and clients can send to relays when they want
to authenticate. When sent by relays, the message is of the following form:

```
["AUTH", <lsat-challenge-string>]
```

And, when sent by clients, of the following form:

```
["AUTH", <signed-event-json>]
```

The signed event is an event message not meant to be published or queried, it must be of `kind: 10402` and it should have at least two tags,
one for the relay URL and one for the challenge string as received from the relay.
The lsat does not need to be satisified as the relay can handle
that by checking invoice status.
`created_at` should be the current time. Example:

```json
{
  "id": "...",
  "pubkey": "...",
  "created_at": 1669695536,
  "kind": 1402,
  "tags": [
    ["relay", "wss://relay.example.com/"],
    ["lsat", "lsat challenge here"]
  ],
  "content": "",
  "sig": "..."
}
```

## Protocol flow

At any moment the relay may send an `AUTH` message to the client containing a challenge. After receiving that the client may decide to
authenticate itself or not. The challenge is expected to be valid for the duration of the connection or until a next challenge is sent by
the relay.

The client may send an auth message right before performing an action for which it knows authentication will be required -- for example, right
before requesting `kind: 4` chat messages --, or it may do right on connection start or at some other moment it deems best. The authentication
is expected to last for the duration of the WebSocket connection.

Upon receiving a message from an unauthenticated user it can't fulfill without authentication, a relay may choose to notify the client. For
that it can use a `NOTICE` or `OK` message with a standard prefix `"restricted: "` that is readable both by humans and machines, for example:

```
["NOTICE", "restricted: we can't serve DMs to unauthenticated users, does your client implement NIP-42?"]
```

or it can return an `OK` message noting the reason an event was not written using the same prefix:

```
["OK", <event-id>, false, "restricted: we do not accept events from unauthenticated users, please sign up at https://example.com/"]
```

## Signed Event Verification

To verify `AUTH` messages, relays must ensure:

- that the `kind` is `1402`;
- that the event `created_at` is close (e.g. within ~10 minutes) of the current time;
- that the `"lsat"` tag matches the challenge sent before;
- that the `"relay"` tag matches the relay URL:
  - URL normalization techniques can be applied. For most cases just checking if the domain name is correct should be enough.
- that the invoice for the lsat has been paid
- will check any other applicable restriction caveats
